# WebScraper
Evabot News Web Scraper
This is a contract project I completed for a sales AI startup, Evabot. 

The project is a Flask-based application to automate the retrieval, extraction, and parsing of articles from
Google search results using custom queries and date filters

I leveraged Playwright and Beautiful Soup libraries to achieve a processing rate of ~100 links per minute

To bypass firewalls and CAPTCHAs, I utilized BrightDataâ€™s residential proxy infrastructure to achieve 87.4% access success rate for target sites.
